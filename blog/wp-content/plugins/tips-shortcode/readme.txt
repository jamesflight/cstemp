== Description ==

Adds a shortcode to show a tip box on any post or page. Simply use the [tip][/tip] shortcode to place the text into a tip box.

You can change the color of the tipBox by using the color attribute. So, to set the tipBox to a light green, simply use: [tip color="lightgreen"][/tip]. Leave out the color to use the default yellow.
